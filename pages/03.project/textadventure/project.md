A modern interpretation of the classic gamebook approach: Instead of presenting the consumer with a linear story, he/she makes choices to influence the progression and ending of the story.

The app can present endless adventures, takes care of character values and value checks and character progression throughout his/her career.

As this project was designed for a [German role playing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Eye), the app is unfortunately only available in German at this moment.
