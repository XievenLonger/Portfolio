Brush a city map and listen to its generated soundtrack.

The music can be controlled by location and size of the created blocks.
There are 8 areas with different instruments and each instrument features up to 11 unique sounds and 30 rhythms.

This is a cooperation project with audio designer Ramon Wiegratz.
