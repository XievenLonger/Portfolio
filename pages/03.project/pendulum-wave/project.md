Futuristic loading animation based on the "Wavemachine of Mach" by [Ernst Mach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Mach).

A series of orbs with decreasing animation speed creates a hypnotic illusion of alternating chaos and wave patterns.
Quite perfect to entertain the user while he/she waits for a service to load.
