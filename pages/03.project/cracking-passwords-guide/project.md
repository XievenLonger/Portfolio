Goal of this small project was to format a raw text as readable as possible, with any means of modern web typography.

This [particular document](link to original) was interesting as it contains many kinds of elements: Table of contents, inline author notes, 
console dumps and code snippets.

I picked the [Droid font family](link to google fonts) as it is fairly fitting: Technical feel, while still friendly and well readable.
